      <p>It all started with a great idea: the emancipation of women. Many women throughout history have played crucial roles in this movement, and two women who have inspired me personally are Katherine Johnson and Jane Austen.

Katherine Johnson was a remarkable black woman who worked as a human computer at NASA. Her calculations of orbital mechanics were essential to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights, and her contributions paved the way for women and people of color in science and engineering. In the movie "Hidden Figures," which tells her story, we see how Katherine overcame discrimination and sexism to achieve greatness.

Jane Austen, on the other hand, was a writer who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. She is famous for her novels, such as "Pride and Prejudice," which portray women in a different light than they were traditionally seen at the time. Austen's characters were strong-willed and intelligent, and she paved the way for women writers to follow in her footsteps.

Both Katherine Johnson and Jane Austen have something in common: they defied traditional gender roles and helped pave the way for women to achieve their full potential.

For me, reading about these remarkable women inspired me to pursue a career in science and engineering. I am a woman, and I know firsthand how challenging it can be to break into male-dominated fields. But I am not deterred; I am motivated to succeed and prove that women can excel in any field they choose.

In addition to reading about these remarkable women, I have also read many books that have inspired me to pursue my dreams. One such book is "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. This novel tells the story of a young shepherd boy who sets out to fulfill his dreams and discover his purpose in life. Reading "The Alchemist" gave me the courage to pursue my own dreams, and it has been an invaluable source of inspiration for me.

At the age of 18, I left my home and moved to London alone. This was a daunting step, but it was also an opportunity for me to prove to myself that I could be independent and self-sufficient. I worked long hours, took on multiple jobs, and ate junk food just to make ends meet. But through it all, I remained committed to my goal of becoming a successful computer scientist and engineer.

Over the years, I have accomplished a great deal. I found my first job, completed a year-long course to advance my career, and eventually went to university. These achievements required a lot of sacrifice and hard work, but they were worth it.

There have been many obstacles along the way, and at times, I have struggled with panic attacks and depression. But I am determined to overcome these challenges and achieve my goals.

Looking back on my journey, I am proud of what I have accomplished. I am grateful for the women who have inspired me, the books that have motivated me, and the experiences that have shaped me. And as I continue to pursue my dreams, I know that I will face more challenges, but I am ready to face them head-on.

In conclusion, the story of Katherine Johnson and Jane Austen reminds us that women can achieve greatness in any field. It is up to us to break down the barriers that stand in our way and pursue our dreams with courage and determination.</p>
